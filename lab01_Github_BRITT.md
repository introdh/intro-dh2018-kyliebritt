### Film: *Sorry to Bother You* (2018)

If you have had the opportunity to see this film, you know exactly why it is memorable. On a random July day, I dragged my unsuspecting roommate to the movie theater to support a black produced-directed Oakland-based passion project called *Sorry to Bother You.* Long story short, we had no idea what we were walking into.

### Film: *To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar* (1995)

I had the absolute honor of seeing this movie in the Hollywood Cemetary in LA for Pride Movie Night this June. It was an outdoor, bring-your-own chairs and picnic type of event, featuring guest speakers (Lena Waithe!) and rainbows everywhere. *To Wong Foo* just happens to be my second favorite drag queen road trip movie, so it was extremely memorable seeing this with hundreds of other gays, my mom, and under the Hollywood stars.
