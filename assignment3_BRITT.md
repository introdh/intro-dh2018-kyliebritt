*Discuss the process of creating your data, building your map in ArcGIS Online, and selecting which points to feature in your Storymap.*

Creating data was easy once I was able to distinguish locations on Google Maps. I could easily zoom and select coordinates for any location. When making the storymap, I organized by activity (such as class and work) until my data showed the out-of-the-ordinary travel, which I represented chronologically. That way, it was easier for me to tell a story, because I could describe my relationship to space at UR, and then extrapolate that to an exceptional experience. 

When telling a cohesive story, I considered what visual accompaniment should be used for each slide. For most, it was my data points from the map, zoomed in to what region I was discussing. For the opening slide, I thought it was important to show all of UR, so that moving to Atlanta would seem like as big of a jump to the reader as it did for me. Using the story features, I was able to include images to enhance the story, links for further information, and additional map data to supplement my discussions of place.

*Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space and place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?*

Using the lens of "critical GIS," Jeremy Crampton describes maps as non-neutral, meaning that will always be political actors in any account of storytelling. (Crampton, "Mapping", 2010). My map certainly represents that, as it clearly leaves out pieces that are important to telling the whole story of Life at UR. For instance, I am not a business school student, so I have no data points in the Robins School of Business. Anyone who were to use my map as an example of a typical student at UR would be getting a very Kylie-centric version of the story. In that same way, the map is easily narrowed down to represent the places and spaces in which I am most comfortable or at least visit most frequently. As long as the distinction is made, I think this map could be a useful tool for anyone who would be interested in knowing *my* relationship to UR.

Though my map only represents a week in time, I can see how tracking changes over a longer period of time could be useful in showing how my relationships to different locations (particularly on campus) change. David Bodenhamer challenges map-makers to consider history as representative of change over space *and* time, which could elucidate more individualized stories based on regions or smaller locales. (Bodenhamer, "Beyond GIS", 2014). The distinction between space and place also seemed to emerge in my map, particularly in Atlanta, where I had nothing interesting to show in terms of spatial data, but my relationship to the location was influenced by the conference I attended. I experienced that *place* through the *space* created by the National Women's Studies Association, and that experience is inextricable from my relationship to Atlanta. 

*Limits and possibilities of Mapping/ Spatial Analysis*

Spatial analysis offers the opportunity to tell very unique stories that may not often get told. Everyone, regardless of power or location, has a relationship to the space around them. In this way, data for any single individual or community can be mapped in a way that tells an important story about them. The maps can also produce new knowledge about the patterns of change over time and space, particularly in smaller groups or individuals. By using a spatial analysis, new discoveries can be made about new subjects, whether presently or historically.

Some limits of spatial analysis and mapping include subjective interpretation and representation. The way a map-maker has chosen to represent the space cannot be known by the viewer unless explicitly stated, so bias or other subjectivity cannot be accounted for. It may also be difficult to represent both space *and* time in a method like storymapping, so some of the complexity of the data may be lost.
