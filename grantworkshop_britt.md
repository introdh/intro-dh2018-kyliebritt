## NEH Grant Proposal Description ##

The Jewish Culture Festival held each year in Kazimierz, the old Jewish Quarter of Krakow, Poland, features workshops, performances, vendors, and more. The schedule and event descriptions are kept in a program which are available to the public online. I would like to do a text analysis of those programs (for the past ten years) to see what themes are being most publicized, supported, and discussed. I will also look into making the information from my text analysis publically available in connection to the programs online, so that further study can be done on what aspects of identity are the most important to the festival and how to adjust the festival to be more diverse (if needed) in its approach to Jewish identity and culture.

* Research questions:*

What themes of Jewish identity are most associated with the Jewish Culture Festival in Kazimierz?

Have these themes changed over the last ten years?

Do these themes reflect popular topics within Jewish/Polish dialogue?
