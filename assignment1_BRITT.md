<h3>Journal: European Judaism (1968-2017)</h3>

**What is the scope of the journal?**

*European Judaism* is a biannual journal published for the expansion of scholarship on postwar European Jewish Studies. There is importance in developing a space for sharing Jewish history and studies to build a unified but diverse Jewish consciousness especially after the Holocaust. 

It is important to have an understanding of the mass of documents to be analyzed so that the topics produced can lead to more discovery rather than false conclusions. (Brett, JDH, 2012). 

**What question(s) are you trying to answer?**

The questions I have formulated are based off my independent study into the history of Jewish identity and memory in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. 

How is the Holocaust memorialized or intentionally forgotten? Perhaps not by Jewish scholars, but by the rest of Europe.

How was Jewish identity constructed in Eastern Europe (the Soviet Bloc) during the Cold War?

To what extent does gender influence the memorializing of the plight of Eastern European Jews?

As I was scanning some articles of this *The Slavic and European Review*, I realized that this journal may not provide enough information regarding European Jewry to answer my questions. I searched for more journals and settled on *European Judaism*, which I believe can provide better analysis of post-war Jewish studies. As Goldstone and Underwood understood that PMLA could not represent all of modern language perfectly, I knew any journal would leave out some important issues/concepts, but topic modeling a journal about my subject could give insight into trends across time. (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012).

**Which data did you select for the corpus? Make sure to specify the kind of data and periodization.**

I selected all 49 years of data available, since arguments on Holocaust and Jewish memory developed in the late 1970s- early 1980s, and I wanted to see how that compared to today.

The articles included in each issue may range from literary studies, theology, history, to cultural studies. The mention of certain words in any of these articles may indicate the extent of memory regarding any given Jewish issue/event/identity. 

**Why the number of topics?**

After much trial and error, I selected 25 topics to be the most accurately grouped. There are groups that focus on specific nationalities, some that reference theology, and some that group and separate different Jewish identities. When I used too many topics, the groups became fragmented, for example, a group on the role of rabbis in synagogue and beyond was divided into topics on individual influential rabbis. 

**What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us? Certain patterns? Trends?**

My first discovery within the topics was finding most discussion of the Holocaust and its impacts to be relegated into one topic. The words associated with the Holocaust, such as *Auschwitz, survivors,* and *camps* are clearly grouped, but may not represent all of the articles about the impacts of the Final Solution. Other words that may be more easily associated with identity or war could appear more frequently in articles about the impacts of the Holocaust outside Europe or in postwar years. 

Having historical context, I am not surprised that the words *Germany, Poland,* and *anti-semitism* are grouped. This indicates to me that the memories of post-war anti-semitism in the Eastern Bloc are being preserved by scholars. 
I may be able to develop an argument that connects the limited scope of Holocaust impacts to its "purposeful forgetting" by many Europeans, but I would have to back up any conclusion with plenty of humanities-based evidence. 

**Drawing on the readings, what are the possibilities and limitations of text analysis and topic modeling?**

Even by looking at the topics of one journal, I can see how the results produced could be easily manipulated to draw conclusions that may not be grounded in evidence. Elijah Meeks and Scott Weingart warn that any understanding of topic modeling results will come from a deep connection to the humanities concepts that the documents are based in. (Meeks and Weingart, JDH, 2012). For example, someone unfamiliar with Jewish studies after WWII may assume that there are limited articles that discuss or address the impacts of the Holocaust. However, many scholars of Jewish history know that such ethnic cleansing has effects that reach into every other aspect of study, even if the common phrases associated with the Holocaust are not used.

Similarly, Ted Underwood urges researchers looking into distant reading as a method of text analysis to maintain the focus on humanities and not the digitization of the work. The results of distant reading are not important because they appear on computers and the Internet, but because they can provide insight to questions in humanities fields that otherwise may not have gotten answered. (Underwood, DHQ, 2017).

Matthew Jockers echoes Underwood's sentiments, and stresses the method of macroanalysis as a way to enhance research into fields such as literature and history. (Jockers, *Macroanalysis*, 2013).
Topic models themselves are extraordinarily helpful in boiling down lots and lots of text into categories that may elucidate patterns and trends. It may show that one journal favors topics that are American-based, and one is more international in its scope. I found the example of Martha Ballard's library to be especially intriguing since historian Cameron Blevins discovered patterns within a single figure's lifetime. (Blevins, personal blog, 2009).

**Connection to History Research**

My study into Jewish identity during the post-war era has led to findings of purposeful forgetting. The tragedies of the Holocaust were intentionally erased by Soviets controlling the Eastern Bloc in order to paint the Russian nationalists as the “real victims” and Jews as “martyrs for communism.” Since *European Judaism* is a journal with articles published by mostly Jewish studies scholars, it is unlikely for them to have “forgotten” the Holocaust in the way that Soviets attempted. The topic entitled “Holocaust Memory” features scholarship regarding memory and experience of the Holocaust, and it is not surprising that the terms within this topic were grouped together. 

I was surprised that the category I titled “European Museums” has no mention of the terms *Holocaust, Anti-Semitism,* or even *violence.* While it is entirely possible that these terms have all fallen into other categories, it also may be indicative of what those museums are lacking when they curate Jewish history. 

My studies have focused generally on the experiences of Eastern Bloc Jews, and it is clear that one thing connecting most Jews in this period is the experience of Anti-Semitism. In the topic “Anti-Semitism in E. Europe,” there is, again, an astounding lack of words associated with the Holocaust. Many Soviets and Eastern Europeans considered the Holocaust as something that affected all of Eastern Europe and was not an ethnic-based genocide, so it was easy to disassociate the topic from Jews. However, the term *Nazi* appears more frequently in this topic than in “Holocaust Memory,” which leads me to ask, *is this topic and its corresponding scholarship more interested in the influence of Nazi ideology on Eastern Europeans than the impact of the actual Holocaust?* This could be a very interesting field of study if it can explain more of the “purposeful forgetting” by Eastern Europe. 

The topic called “War for Israel” is the only other appearance of the word *Holocaust* outside of the “Holocaust Memory” category. While this topic seems to be related to the diaspora and Israel-Palestinian violence, it is interesting that the words *Holocaust* and *Auschwitz* are some of the most frequent words accounted for in this category. This prompts me to look for scholarship explaining this connection. Perhaps there are many similarities between Jewish identity during the Holocaust and while advocating for a homeland? This question would need to be answered with more intimate study. 

Clearly European Jewish scholarship covers more topics than just the Holocaust and its memory, and the topics produced by this method illustrate that. There are other issues and major concepts elucidated by different topics. In the category titled “European Jewry,” it is clear that European Jews have been and are associated with Zionism and post-war diaspora. My research backs up these findings, and illustrates the beginning of Zionist and Communist associations, which categorized Jews into “progressive” (Communist, leftist) or “reactionary” camps (Zionist, nationalist). 

I am interested in researching the impacts of Holocaust memory in interfaith dialogue. None of the topics that represent such dialogue, ie “Muslim Dialogue” or “Christian Dialogue”, contain words that associate the topic with war-time memory, but I may need to look at some articles specifically to understand the context for such dialogue. 

The experience of topic modeling this group of documents has prompted some new questions and different ways of approaching a variety of concepts. I may use this method to explore the association of Jews with different movements in the Eastern Bloc, perhaps by modeling documents published by the Soviet governments in that region. Overall, I have gained a way to visualize the topics that are and are not remembered in popular Jewish scholarship.
