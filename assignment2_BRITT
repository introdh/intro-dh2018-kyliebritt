# Network Analysis: Polish Jews in Positions of Power, 1944-1956#

##Data:##
In early postwar Poland, it was not uncommon for Jews to be appointed to high positions of power. Stalin himself even appointed some Jews to run some essential departments. I wondered if there were any patterns to the organizations that Polish Jews ran, and how a Network Analysis could elucidate the relationships of those organizations and their leaders. 
My nodes represent different officials of Jewish heritage, and they are connected by edges which represent a shared organization. For this analysis, I counted a "shared organization" as a group in which both people held leadership positions. 
There are only nine figures represented in my analysis, but up to six edges connecting a single leader. By analyzing the structure of a network, I intend to suggest some trends about Polish Jews in leadership positions.

The above image shows the degree values of my nodes, and visually spaces each node and shows the edges. It is clear that some people are connected to only one or two others, but that some have many connections within this data set.
